# websocket_interact_with_net_socket

This tiny script shows how to establich interaction betweeen WebSocket API and Node.js net.Socket instance.

Of course you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws">WebSocket</a> module on the server to give your client and server the same "language" to speak - WebSocket protocol. Also, you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io">Socket.io</a>, however, this code will let you get more details and understanding about WebSocket protocol and sockets in general. 

More details about <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">WebSocket Protocol</a>.

Definitely, treat this code only like some studying material.
